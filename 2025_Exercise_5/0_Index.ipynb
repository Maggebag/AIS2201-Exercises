    "# Assignment 5 - Spectral leakage, window functions and spectrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this exercise is to explore the limitations of Discrete Fourier Transformation as a tool in frequency analysis, and different approaches to managing these limitations. Finally, we will  take a closer look at the spectrogram as an analysis tool, and how the various parameters for spectrogram calculation affect the quality of our output.\n",

    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course we have focused heavily certain deterministic signals which allow a \"clean\" frequency representation when calculating an $N$-point DFT. More precisely, our examples have concerned themselves with analyzing signals where the $N$ samples used for frequency decomposition will repeat immediately afterward. In the real world however this is not usually the case, and it is important to be aware of the affect this has on the frequency-domain representation of our signal.\n",
