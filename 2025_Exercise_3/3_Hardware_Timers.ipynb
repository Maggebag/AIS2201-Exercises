    "#### Introduction to hardware peripherals:\n",
    "\n",
    "On a microcontroller such as the STM32, hardware peripherals are separate hardware components capable of performing specialized tasks in accordance with a set of instructions provided by the executing program. When programming in for instance Arduino C, the interaction with hardware peripherals is hidden by a layer of abstraction. This removes a lot of the complexity of programming a microcontroller, but also places constrains on how those peripheral components can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling an analog signal at a uniform sampling rate is $f_s$ a very clear case where making full use of hardware peripherals can result in a more efficient (and likely reliable) system. When a microprocessor program uses functions such as [`analogRead()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/analog-io/analogRead/) to read from an analog input, it is up to the software to keep track of *when* to start the analog-to-digital conversions. By appropriate configuration of a Hardware Timer in conjunction with an Analog-to-Digital Converter(ADC) it is possible to offload the job of managing sampling times to these two hardware peripherals, and only requiring the CPU to intervene when the sampled data is ready for further processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- The configuration of hardware peripherals is - at the end of the day - accomplished by manipulating [*registers*], using reserved macros in the programming language to access individual bits in the registers. Luckily, many hardware providers suppliers (ST Microelectronics included) will often supply libraries which manage separate hardware components without requiring the programmer to implement all the fiddly register manipulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "this problem, we will cover some basic theory of how the two aforementioned hardware peripherals work, and how certain sets of configuration will allow for sampling a signal at a set sample rate.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timer basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardware timers are relatively simple digital circuits which are used to generate PWM signals, set the symbol rate for serial communication, and much more. It is controlled by a clock signal input (usually an internal clock signal), and can trigger an update event at specific time intervals. Very briefly explained, the main component is a *counting register* which can increment the binary number stored in the register by `1` for each clock cycle. Then, when the counting register reaches a pre-configured value stored in a separate `Auto Reload Register`, the timer generates an output, and all the bits in the counting register are set to `0` so the timer can begin counting up again. It is important to note that counting starts at `0` and stops at the`ARR` value, meaning the time between resets will be `ARR`$+1$ clock cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it is possible to configure a clock prescaler to scale down the input clock signal to the timer. The prescaler can be any integer value, although once again the factor by which the clock signal is scaled will be `Prescaler` $+1$ (otherwise a prescaler value of $0$ would imply dividing the clock speed by $0$). The illustration below shows how a simplified hardware timer configuration converts a clock signal into a pulse every $6$ clock cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/Timer_illustration.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One highly relevant use for update event generated by a hardware timer is to trigger an A/D conversion, meaning the ADC will read one sample from the analog input each time it is triggered by the hardware timer's trigger event. Assuming the full ADC conversion time is lower than the time between timer trigger events, the ADC's sampling frequency can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_s = \\frac{\\text{System Clock Speed}}{\\text{Prescaler Register Value}+1}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\text{Auto Reload Register (ARR) Value } + 1} \\tag{3.1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended you refer to [this](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Getting_started_with_TIM) guide for more information on the STM32's timers.\n",

Using default system settings for the STM32F446re, the peripheral clock controlling our timer will be $84 \\text{ MHz}$.
