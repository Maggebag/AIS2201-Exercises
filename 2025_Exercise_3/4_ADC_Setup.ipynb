    "#### Introduction to the SAR ADC\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task we will learn about how the built-in ADCs on a STM32 F446re Nucleo Board works, and how it is configured to exercise certain behaviours. There are three ADCs available to us, and all of them are [successive approximation register adcs (SAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive-approximation_ADC). Sampling with a SAR ADC is controlled by a clock signal, and happens in two stages:\n",
    "1. The input voltage is fed to a \"sample & hold\" circuit, which functions as a capacitor and switch. In the \"sample\" phase of, the capacitor is connected to the signal input, and charges to track the input voltage. Once a certain number of clock cycles are completed, the input line is disconnected from the capacitor, leaving the current stored in  the capacitor with nowhere to go. The voltage over the capacitor will now remain constant, while the successive approximation register performs the conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/sample_hold.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The successive approximation register converts the capacitor voltage to a binary number using something akin to [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search) to \"home in\" on the precise capacitor voltage. The circuit will be able to do 1 bisection step (i.e. generating 1 bit of the ADC output value) per clock cycle, meaning a 12 bit A/D conversion requires at minimum 12 clock cycles. Then comes some overhead for clearing registers between conversions etc. [**Here is an animated illustration**](Figures/SAR.gif) showing a 6-bit SAR performing a single conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--![](Figures/ADC_block_diagram.png)-->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SAR conversion time\n",
    "\n",
    "A limiting factor for precisely how fast a signal may be sampled is the time it takes to complete one conversion. There are a number of parameters influencing the total A/D conversion time, and for a SAR ADC such as the one in the STM32 F446re microcontroller, these paramters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--For simple systems using analog input without strict requirements to high sampling speed it is usually sufficient to keep the ADC in \"single conversion mode\", where each A/D conversion is initiated by a function call (such as `analogRead()` on an arduino). However, it is also possible to configure the ADC to begin a new A/D conversion immediately after completing the previous one. In this case, the sampling frequency will be determined by a number of factors which will vary depending on the type of ADC. For a Successive Approximation ADC such as the one in a STM32 F446RE, these factors are:-->\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Peripheral Clock Signal**: A square wave clock signal generated by prescaling the system clock by some integer factor. Controls the working speed of a number of peripheral components, including the ADC. Genera\n",
    "* **ADC Clock Prescaler**: An integer factor which determines the clock speed of the ADC relative to peripheral clock.\n",
    "    * Example: If the peripheral clock is $84 \\text{MHz}$, and the ADC clock prescaler is $8$, the ADC clock signal will be $\\frac{84\\text{ MHz}}{8} = 10.5 \\text{MHz}$\n",
    "* **Sample time:** Number of ADC clock cycles to wait while charging up the capacitor. This amounts to the duration of the \"sample\" phase of A/D converison.\n",
    "    * Example: If the sample time is $3$ clock cycles, and the conversion time is $15$ clock cycles, then the total number of clock cycles spent converting a single sample is $T = 3 + 15 = 18$.\n",
    "* **Conversion time:** Equivalent to the \"hold\" phase in A/D converison, and is determined by the ADC resolution (more bits = more time). For the STM32 F446RE a 12-bit conversion (full resolution) requires $15$ clock cycles.\n",
    " \n",
    "## a)\n",
    "Given the ADC settings specified below, how many microseconds ($\\mu \\text{s}$) does it take for the ADC to complete $1$ analog-to-digital conversion, and what is the maximum sampling rate we can use when configuring the Hardware Timer?\n",
    "<!-- Calculate the sampling frequency for an ADC with the following settings, and present the answer in $\\text{Hz}$:-->\n",
